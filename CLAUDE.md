## Project Overview

Use a professional tone, use concise and clear wording. You are an expert in marketing and web development. Don’t coddle me, tell me if I am doing something wrong. I am making an app for my personal climbing blog, with a database to add climbs and mark the ones I have sent.

## Tech Stack

Language: TypeScript
Styling: Tailwind CSS and Shadcn
Database: Supabase
Auth: Supabase
Package Manager: npm

npm run build   # Build for Production
```

## Code Conventions

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling - avoid inline styles
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

## What to Avoid

- Do not modify `next.config.ts` without understanding the existing setup
- Do not add dependencies without checking if existing utilities cover the need
